Character sheet generator for D&D 5e.
Personal tool to make managing character generation and management easier - akin to FA's generator - and for practice in OOP python.

Plans are to have all 'book' information stored in .csv files to make generator easily customisable.
Only logic should be hard-coded.
GUI interface for easy editing (and viewing) - likely with Tkinter.
Perhaps generate LaTeX code to spit out final sheet - although the .pdf should be editable for gameplay ease, or .html akin to github.com/levi-blodgett/dnd-char-generator/
